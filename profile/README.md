## Introduction :deciduous_tree:
The ClimaTree team is our Master in Evionmental Data Science capstone project at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Managment.

The team consists of [Rosemary Juarez](https://github.com/rosemaryjuarez) , [Briana Barajas](https://github.com/briana-barajas), [Fletcher McConnell](https://github.com/fletcher-m) and [Vanessa Salgado](https://github.com/Vanessa-Salgado). 

## Project Overview :evergreen_tree:
The objective of this project is to generate accurate vulnerability risk maps for over 126 tree species that capture exposure and sensitivity to illustrate adaptive and spatial variation in response to climate change and predict future tree growth. 

We aim to
* Create more accurate risk maps for over 126 vulnerable species of trees :earth_americas:
* Predict future tree growth using machine learning :chart_with_upwards_trend:
* Develop a shiny app that combines this information on an easily accessible and user-friendly platform :computer:

Directions:
Update GitHub organization & team management plan
Update:

Your GitHub organization’s landing page to include the project summary you submitted a on week 2. 

Delete all the repositories, issues, and projects from today’s demo sessions.

Your team management plan sections V and VI to include the GitHub tools we covered today (if your team will use them - highly encouraged!).

Create a skeleton of repositories, some issues and milestones, and a project to track the bigger steps of your Approach & Methods section.
